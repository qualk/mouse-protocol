/**
 * GearHub-V5 codec — the transport-independent half of support for the
 * MicLink/mlzn ODM platform on VID 0x3151 (qmk.top's "GearHub-V5" web tool).
 *
 * This layer knows packet shapes, command ids, the Bit7 checksum, the report-
 * rate table, and the device catalog. It knows nothing about WebHID or the
 * 2.4 GHz relay — that lives in `src/drivers/gearhub/hid.ts`.
 *
 * VID 0x3151 belongs to the ODM, not to any one brand: several unrelated
 * makers ship on it. A GearHub-V5 mouse is identified by the GET_USB_VERSION
 * *device id* (the same key GearHub's own bundle looks its model table up by),
 * never by product id — the receiver's VID:PID is shared. The product id only
 * settles transport (2.4 GHz receiver vs. direct cable).
 *
 * Everything here was read out of GearHub-V5's own JS bundle and confirmed
 * byte for byte on hardware: a Lingbao M5 Pro (PAW3395, device id 2285) and an
 * Attack Shark R2 (PAW3950, device id 1893), both on the 2.4 GHz receiver
 * (0x3151:0x402D), Windows 11.
