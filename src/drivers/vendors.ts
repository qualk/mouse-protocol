 * battery-only tool whose device table cross-confirms the "wired PID +

 * for lookup convenience; isSupported() also checks the VID.
 *
 * `generation` gates which commands the driver will actually send:
 * - "core1": the original protocol korkje/mxw reverse-engineered. Full
 *   support — RGB, debounce, battery (glorious-ctl), DPI/polling/LOD (mxw).
 * - "core2": a newer, mostly-undocumented protocol generation (the 4K/8K-class
 *   mice: Model O3 Wireless, Model O2 Pro 4K/8K, Model D2 Pro 4K/8K). Only
 *   RGB, debounce, and battery are enabled for these — glorious-ctl's own
 *   `devices.json` lists Model O3/D2Pro-4K8K alongside the core1 devices and
 *   applies the exact same `mouse.py` commands uniformly, and
 *   AwesomeTy18/GloriousBatteryMonitor independently confirms the exact same
 *   battery-read command (byte-for-byte: class 0x02, subclass 0x02, command
 *   0x83) works across its ENTIRE device list, core1 and core2 alike — two
 *   unrelated implementations agreeing is real evidence RGB/debounce/battery
 *   carry over. DPI, polling rate, and lift-off distance stay OFF for core2:
 *   korkje/mxw's own device list does not include any core2 model, and (for
 *   polling rate specifically) https://github.com/AMarcinkiewicz/GloriousAutoPollingRate
 *   shows the Model D2 Pro 4K/8K's real polling-rate command uses a
 *   DIFFERENT usage page (0xFFFF/0x0000) and report layout entirely from the
 *   one below — confirming core2 is not just core1 with new values, so
 *   guessing at DPI/LOD offsets for it would likely be silently wrong. See
 *   [[glorious-classic-protocol]] in memory for the full writeup, including
 *   the exact D2 Pro 4K/8K polling-rate bytes for whoever wires that in
 *   (needs multi-interface HID support this driver doesn't have yet).
 *
 * KNOWN UNRESOLVED DISCREPANCY: glorious-ctl's devices.json labels PID
 * 0x2011 "Model D Wireless", but two independent, more structured sources
 * (RealCrystalNight's Rust device enum and AwesomeTy18's C# device table)
 * both instead pair 0x2011 with Model O (as its wired-mode PID, alongside
 * receiver 0x2022) and put Model D's wired-mode PID at 0x2012. This table
 * follows the 2-source majority below; if a real Model D Wireless answers
 * "Model O Wireless" in the app, that's why — it's cosmetic only (the actual
 * commands are identical either way), but worth fixing with a hardware
 * report from whoever it happens to.
